# Project Scope: Rewards Program Perks and Customer Segmentation

## Background and Objectives

The initial stage of this project focuses on supporting the design of a customer rewards program. The analyst’s role is to validate which perks are most attractive to customers and to segment customers according to their likely preferred perk. These insights will enable the marketing team to personalize invitations and increase sign‑ups.

## Phase 1: Validate Rewards Program Perks

- Evaluate the proposed perks for attractiveness and potential to drive engagement.  
- Proposed perks (preliminary list):  
  - Free hotel meal  
  - Free checked bag  
  - No cancellation fee  
  - Exclusive discounts  
  - One night free hotel with flight  
- Recommend adjustments or alternatives if data suggests stronger options.

## Phase 2: Customer Segmentation

- Analyze customer data to identify distinct segments.  
- Determine the likely “favorite” perk for each segment.  
- Provide a mapping of segments to perks to support personalized invitations.

## Deliverables

- A validated, data‑backed list of perks for the rewards program.  
- Customer segments with clear behavioral and demographic profiles.  
- Mapping of each segment to a preferred perk.  

## Assumptions and Constraints

- Customer data required for segmentation will be available and reliable.  
- Proposed perks are preliminary and subject to validation.  
- Marketing team will design and execute the personalized email campaign using these insights.
