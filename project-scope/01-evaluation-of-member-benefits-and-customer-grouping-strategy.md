# Project Scope: Evaluation of Member Benefits & Customer Grouping Strategy

## Overview and Goals

This project’s first phase centers on informing the development of a new membership benefits program. The analyst’s responsibility is to assess which benefits resonate most strongly with customers and to classify customers into groups based on the perks they are most likely to prefer. These findings will support the marketing team in tailoring outreach and maximizing program enrollment.

## Phase 1: Assess Membership Benefit Options

- Review the proposed list of benefits to gauge overall appeal and expected impact on customer engagement. 
- Preliminary benefit options include:   
  - Free checked bag  
  - No cancellation fee  
  - Exclusive discounts  
  - One night free hotel with flight  
- Suggest refinements, additions, or replacements if the data indicates more compelling alternatives.

## Phase 2: Customer Segmentation

- Analyze customer data to identify distinct segments.  
- Determine the likely “favorite” perk for each segment.  
- Provide a mapping of segments to perks to support personalized invitations.

## Deliverables

- A validated, data‑backed list of perks for the rewards program.  
- Customer segments with clear behavioral and demographic profiles.  
- Mapping of each segment to a preferred perk.  

## Assumptions and Constraints

- Customer data required for segmentation will be available and reliable.  
- Proposed perks are preliminary and subject to validation.  
- Marketing team will design and execute the personalized email campaign using these insights.
